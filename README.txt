A remnant of Blacky the Hedgehog who was banned from Gamebanana for being underage, a mod which was originally from Hortinus and Motor Roach (All credit to them) and Modified to include the palette from RHS v3 (My mod), and his own palette (Black for the Quills and Shoes, mimicking his new avatar. He was originally called Light Zenitsu on Youtube, where I got the file from). And there is a file for an unmodified RHS mod v3, but I'm not including it (for the original file is on Gamebanana). If you want to download a Modern RHS Mod, Download the Original and make a palette to go over it. If you wan't to download a RHS mod, there are a ton of RHS mods on Gamebanana. But if you wan't the file that wasn't includedm, Download v3 from my page, it is my first mod, and I don't delete any old versions.
